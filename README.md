# Reinforcement Learning Labs

Welcome to the **Reinforcement Learning Labs** repository! This collection features hands-on implementations of various Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, each explored in dedicated labs. Each lab demonstrates the application of a specific RL technique through practical examples and detailed explanations.

## üìÅ Repository Overview

### **Lab 1: Q-Learning**
- **Overview**: This lab focuses on the implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm, a model-free reinforcement learning technique used to solve problems in discrete state spaces.

---

### **Lab 2: Deep Q-Learning**
- **Overview**: This lab extends the classic Q-Learning algorithm by incorporating Deep Neural Networks to handle high-dimensional state spaces. Key concepts covered include experience replay and target networks, essential for stable learning in complex environments.

---

### **Lab 3: Policy Gradient Methods**
- **Overview**: In this lab, we explore policy-based RL methods, which directly optimize the policy function rather than relying on a value function. It includes implementations of the REINFORCE algorithm and other policy gradient techniques.

---

### **Lab 4: Actor-Critic Methods**
- **Overview**: This lab combines both value-based and policy-based methods by training two models simultaneously: an actor (policy) and a critic (value function).  
  - **Projects**:
    - `LunarLander-v2-Actor-Critic`: Solving the Lunar Lander environment using the Actor-Critic method.
    - `CartPole-v1-Actor-Critic`: Applying the Actor-Critic method to balance a pole on a cart.

Each lab provides detailed implementations and guides for better understanding and applying these algorithms in different RL problems. Enjoy exploring the world of Reinforcement Learning!
